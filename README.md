This is a fork of https://github.com/caminocomms/aip-quiz which provides a static site deployed via GitHub pages at https://mindset.adventuresinpharma.com/

This fork is to expand the quiz site to use external AI services to transform the guest into an AI generated image based on the character determined by their quiz results. They wil be able to either use their Webcam to take a photo or upload an existing one. 

Note: We won't be able to host this via GitHub pages as the functionality will need to use a backend Python and GitHub pages is limited to HTML and Basic JS.
